# US_Visa_Approval_Docker_AWS
In this project we will be predicting whether your US Visa has been approved or not based on a number of features. This will enable us to enhance our resume and skills, in order to improve our chances getting the Visa approval. We will use MongoDB to import data, Docker, GITHUB ACTIONS for CI/CD pipelines and deploy the application using AWS EC2.
